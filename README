During graduate school I've used version control to manage notes, assignments,
projects, and other coursework-related files. My class repos have been scattered
across different systems, so this repo is an attempt to bring them all together.
Notes for some of my classes are more complete than for others--I don't intend
to do anything about this, I just wanted to have a single location from which I
could access those parts of my graduate coursework for which I have an
electronic record.
